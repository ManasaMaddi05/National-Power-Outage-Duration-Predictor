## Introduction

### Dataset and Project Introduction

In this project, we are examining a dataset on the major power outages in the United States from January 2000 to July 2016. This dataset comes from https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages/outagerisks. According to the Department of Energy, a major outage is classified to be an outage that has impacted atleast 50,000 customers or "caused an unplanned firm load loss atleast 300 MW". The data also contains geographic location, data and time, regional climate information, land-use characteristics, electricity consumption patterms, and the affected states' economic characteristics. We are interested in various relationships, such as the effect of number of affected customers, cause category, regional information, and climate anomalies on the duration of outage.

### Research Question

How do various environmental, infrastructural, and economic factors impact 

### Dataset Significance

### Dataset Summary
* Total Rows: 1,534
* Columns:

### **Selecting Relevant Features**  

#### **Step 1: Filtering Necessary Columns**  
We began by removing irrelevant columns and retaining only those essential for our analysis. The selected columns emphasize environmental, infrastructural, and economic factors influencing power outage duration. The final dataset includes:  

- **General Information**: `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `U.S._STATE`, `NERC.REGION`  
- **Climate & Environmental Factors**: `CLIMATE.REGION`, `ANOMALY.LEVEL`, `CLIMATE.CATEGORY`  
- **Outage Event Information**: `OUTAGE.START.DATE`, `OUTAGE.START.TIME`, `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE`, `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME`, `CAUSE.CATEGORY`, `CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL`, `HURRICANE.NAMES`, `OUTAGE.DURATION`, `DEMAND.LOSS.MW`, `CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED`  
- **Economic & Infrastructure Factors**: `TOTAL.PRICE`, `PC.REALGSP.STATE`, `UTIL.CONTRI`  
- **Urbanization & Population Density**: `POPULATION`, `POPPCT_URBAN`, `POPDEN_URBAN`, `AREAPCT_URBAN`  

#### **Step 2: Converting Outage Duration to Hours**  
Since `OUTAGE.DURATION` was initially recorded in minutes, we created a new column:  



This conversion simplifies interpretation when analyzing outage severity.

#### **Step 3: Creating New Features**  
To enhance the dataset, we introduced two new features to capture key patterns:  

1. **Urbanization Metric**:  



This metric normalizes the percentage of urban population, urban density, and urban land area.  

2. **Outage Duration in Hours**:
