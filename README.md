## Introduction

### Dataset and Project Introduction

In this project, we are examining a dataset on the major power outages in the United States from January 2000 to July 2016. This dataset comes from https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages/outagerisks. According to the Department of Energy, a major outage is classified to be an outage that has impacted atleast 50,000 customers or "caused an unplanned firm load loss atleast 300 MW". The data also contains geographic location, data and time, regional climate information, land-use characteristics, electricity consumption patterms, and the affected states' economic characteristics. We are interested in various relationships, such as the effect of number of affected customers, cause category, regional information, and climate anomalies on the duration of outage.

### Research Question

How do various environmental, infrastructural, and economic factors impact
